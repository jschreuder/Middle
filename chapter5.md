# Chapter 5: Secure by Design
*Defensive Programming and Architectural Security*

THIS CHAPTER IS AS YET UNWRITTEN AND ONLY CONTAINS AN OUTLINE OF INTENDED CONTENT

## 5.1 PHP's Unique Security Advantages

- Process isolation and shared-nothing architecture
- How request isolation prevents cross-contamination
- Comparing to shared-state architectures in other languages

## 5.2 Minimal Attack Surface

- Middle's tiny core vs. monolithic frameworks
- Security through simplicity and auditable dependencies
- Controlled dependency selection with "Proudly Found Elsewhere"

## 5.3 Defensive Programming Patterns

- Input validation using RequestValidatorInterface and external libraries
- Request filtering with RequestFilterInterface for sanitization
- Error handling that doesn't leak information
- Type safety with declare(strict_types=1) and interface contracts

## 5.4 Security-First Interface Design

- Using exceptions instead of null returns to prevent silent failures
- Designing interfaces that enforce security invariants
- Value objects for validated data (Email, UUID, etc.)

## 5.5 Authentication and Authorization Architecture

- Session-based vs token-based security models
- Middleware composition for layered security
- Request attribute patterns for user context

## 5.6 Security Testing Approaches

- Testing authentication middleware in isolation
- Validating input filtering and validation
- Integration testing for complete security flows
